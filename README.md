# number-theory-calculator
This is a specialized calculator which allows the user to quickly perform various algorithms used in a basic Number Theory class.
This calculator stores four numbers for the user to use and for the calculator to apply in the algorithms. They are held in four small displays and are accessed by buttons with their respective names. 

When launched, there are two large JTextArea boxes at the top. The first will display the instructions on how any of the four numbers are used in the computation of one of the algorithms. For instance, the "Relatively Prime" checks the "First" and "Second" numbers.

Operations in the red drop down are calculations that do not result in a number while those in the green do. Only calculations from the green side are able to be copied into the current number the user is interacting with. Thus while the calculator will not store the result of "Is Prime?", it will store the result of a "Successive Squaring"

The "Clear" resets the whole calculator, "BackSpace" resets the current number.

NOTE: This class uses many structures from the Bailiey jar file. First create a variable BAILIEY and add it to the project before using this calculator.
